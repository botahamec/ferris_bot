# Discord Bot in Rust

Hello! I'm Botahamec, and this is a bot I made to show how to create a Discord Bot using Rust.

## Usage

This requires that there is a .token file in the main directory, which contains the Discord token for your bot. It will automatically be ignored by Git. Don't worry about it being on GitHub. Then, run the "cargo run" command in the main directory.
